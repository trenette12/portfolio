                        <p> The Era of MySpace<br>Admittedly during this year, I became fascinated with the option to add multimedia
                            to my then MySpace page. I thought it was kind of magical that inserting one piece of code could
                            translate into an element that was customized by me. The manipulation of content, images, videos,
                            audio was intriguing to me so much so that I mentioned my interest to my best friend and she
                            asked me "Why don't you study for that in college"? This conversation along with other members
                            of my family inspired me to begin a journey of studying and experimenting with Web Development.</p>

                        <p>Class of 2014!</br>During various trials and road bumps along the way, I finally received my Bachelor
                            of Science degree in Digital Media and Web Technology. Later that year, I was granted an internship
                            at a non-profit organization as a Web Content Specialist and have been keeping up to date with
                            web technologies and growing in this field ever since. There's no looking back!</p>

                        <p>Who wants Full Stack? Of what Pancakes?</br>A full stack in this case is not in relation to pancakes.
                            This is in reference to Full Stack Web Development. In this year, I took another leap and wanted
                            to challenge myself as a full stack web developer. I was used to working on the front-end but
                            had no real knowledge or experience of what the back-end was, how it worked and most importantly
                            how it communicated with the front-end to create the ultimate user experience. I enrolled in
                            a six month boot camp to further my knowledge and no longer limit myself to just piece of web
                            development. It's a bit mind blowing and exciting how the technologies talk to one another. All
                            questions are never answered, and one bit of advice, there's always more than one answer or one
                            way to perform an operation. There's more to come on this journey but this brings you up to date.</p>
